## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seatle Airbnb data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. Which neighbors in Seatle have most of the Airbnb listings?
3. How to describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here is to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

1.Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
2.Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sygong/airbnb-data-tell-you-when-and-where-to-sleep-in-seattle-96bc6d25ca6e?sk=e12d6217751c11d7c5ea180b2fbd5e61).
